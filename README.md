# 🎬 Movie Rating Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **machine learning model** to classify movies into **Low, Medium, and High rating categories** based on movie metadata and textual information.  
The goal is to understand how structured data and NLP-based features can be combined to solve a real-world classification problem.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Movie platforms host thousands of movies, but understanding their quality or popularity at scale is challenging.  
Manually rating or reviewing movies is time-consuming and subjective.

This project aims to **automatically predict the rating category of a movie** using machine learning techniques.

---

## ✅ Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset  
- Handle missing values and duplicated titles  
- Encode categorical variables effectively  
- Convert text features (movie overview) into numerical form  
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Predict movie rating categories: **Low, Medium, High**

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains movie-related information such as:
- Title  
- Overview (text description)
- Genre
- Original language
- Popularity
- Vote count
- Vote average / rating category (target)

> Dataset is sourced from a real-world movie database.
